题目: Maps into moduli spaces and generic rigidity       
摘要: Introducing the notion of generic rigidity for maps into moduli spaces of projective manifolds with good minimal model. 
We conjecture that a moduli space, which fails  being the generic rigidity, is a Shimura variety of rank >1. We shall discuss some evidences to this conjecture. This is a joint project with Chen-Hu-Sun.

题目: Characterization of non ergodic directions in branched double covers of Veech surfaces    
摘要: A closed Riemann surface together with a holomorphic 1-form on it defines a translation surface, which is none other than a section of the canonical line bundle of the Riemann surface. The collection of all such sections forms a bundle of the moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces, sometimes referred to as the Hodge bundle.  The existence of an action of SL(2,R) on this bundle is one of the main sources of interplay between geometry and dynamics on moduli spaces. When the SL(2,R)-orbit is closed, its projection to moduli space is called a Teichmuller curve and the any holomorphic 1-form with this property is called a Veech surface. Translation surfaces are themselves interesting geometric structures, e.g. they exhibit a 1-parameter family of directional flows and in the case of Veech surfaces as discovered in 1989, these flows exhibit a certain dichotomy: they are either completely periodic or uniquely ergodic. In this talk, I will describe a different kind of dichotomy discovered in 2011 by Cheung-Hubert-Masur that arises from the investigation of the Hausdorff dimension of the set of nonergodic directions. This result relies on an extension of Masur’s divergence obtained by Cheung-Eskin in 2007, which allowed for the characterization of non ergodic directions in the case of branched double covers of flat tori. Recently, my student Yuming WEI has shown how to extend the dichotomy Hausdorff dimension result to the general case of branched double covers of tori. My goal in this talk is to explain how the characterization of non ergodic directions further extends to certain branhed double covers of Veech surfaces.

题目: Jordan property of automorphism groups of surfaces of positive characteristic     
摘要: A classical theorem of C. Jordan asserts the general linear group $GL_n$ over a field of characteristic zero is Jordan. 
That is, any finite subgroup of G contains a normal abelian subgroup of index at most J, where J is an integer only depends on the group G. 
For the Cremona group of rank n, which is the birational automorphism group of the projective space of dim n, J.-P. Serre proved that the Cremona group of rank 2 has Jordan property. Serre conjectured that the Cremona group of rank n has Jordan property. Prokhorov and Shramov proved the Cremona group of rank 3 has Jordan property, and they pointed out Serre's conjecture holds if the boundedness of Fano varieties conjecture (BAB conjecture) holds. As the BAB conjecture is proved by the Fields medalist Caucher Birkar, Serre's conjecture holds. In this talk, we will discuss Jordan property for automorphism groups of surfaces of positive characteristic. This is a joint work with C. Shramov.

题目: A generalization of Witten's Conjecture through spectral curve     
摘要: By reviewing the history of the developments related to the Witten conjecture, we found that all the integrable hierarchies mentioned above are reductions of (multi-component) KP hierarchy. Furthermore, they all have an underlying global spectral curve in the sense of topological recursion. In this talk, we will proposed a generalization of Witten's conjecture. We then focus on the case when there is only one boundary in the spectral curve, and we explain the idea of the proof for this case. This is base on a joint work with Ce Ji and Qingsheng Zhang.

题目: Noether inequality for irregular threefolds of general type    
摘要: Let $X$ be a smooth irregular $3$-fold of general type. 
In this talk, we will prove that the optimal Noether inequality $Vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3}p_g(X)$ holds if $p_g(X) \ge 16$ or if $X$ has a Gorenstein minimal model. 
Moreover, when $X$ attains the equality and $p_g(X) \ge 16$, its canonical model will be explicitly described. This is a joint work with Tong Zhang.  

吕鑫 (华东师范大学)    
题目: The canonical map of a foliated surface of general type   
摘要: In this talk, we will report our study on the canonical map of a foliated surface of general type, which generalizes Beauville's work on the canonical map of an algebraic surface of general type. 
Several boundedness results are proved as well as some interesting examples are constructed. 
As an application, we establish the Noether type inequalities for foliated surfaces of general type.  

方博汉 (北京大学）  
题目: Oscillatory integrals in mirror symmetry  
摘要: I will describe the oscillatory and period integrals on the B-side of mirror symmetry. They correspond to Gromov-Witten primary and descendant invariants of Gamma-modified twisted Chern classes of the mirror coherent sheaves. The cycles for integration correspond to these mirror sheaves by homological mirror symmetry, and one may obtain higher genus invariants if using correct higher genus B-model integrands. I will explain some examples in the setting of toric mirrors and Gross-Hacking-Keel mirror LG models, and discuss application to Gamma conjectures in the toric setting.

题目: On the Hodge theory of Toroidal embeddings and corresponding Vanishings  
摘要: Deligne's logarithmic comparison theorem and the degeneracy of the spectural sequence of logarithmic de Rham complex gives the mixed Hodge structure of a projective smooth variety with a normal crossing boundary divisor. 
In this talk, we will try to build a similar theory on toroidal embeddings. 
In particular, we will show the $E_1$-degeneracy of the spectral sequence of the logarithmic de Rham complex of any toroidal triple. 
This gives a geometric proof of a more general version of Danilov's conjecture.  

张通 (华东师范大学)      
题目: Threefolds on the Noether line  
摘要: It is known by J. Chen, M. Chen and C. Jiang that every complex smooth threefold $X$ of general type with $p_g(X) \ge 11$ satisfies the Noether inequality $Vol(X) \ge 4/3 p_g(X) - 10/3$. 
If $X$ attains the equality, it is said to be on the Noether line. 
In this talk, I will introduce what we know so far about threefolds on the Noether line. 
This is a joint work in progress with S. Coughlan, Y.Hu, and R. Pignatelli.

题目: A Chern numbers identity on compact Kahler-Einstein manifolds and its applications  
摘要: For compact Kahler-Einstein manifolds, we find an expression of Chern numbers in the form of the holomorphic sectional curvatures at a fixed point by means of algebraic invariant theory. 
As applications, we obtain a so-called reverse Miyaoka-Yau's inequality and improve the classical 1/4-pinched theorem and negative 1/4-pinched theorem for compact Kahler-Einstein manifolds to a smaller pinching constant. 
Moreover, we confirm Yau's conjecture on positive holomorphic sectional curvature and Siu-Yang's conjecture on negative holomorphic sectional curvature if the absolute value of the holomorphic sectional curvature is small enough.

题目: Recent progresses on locally symmetric varieties with modular meaning   
摘要: An important topic in complex algebraic geometry is to realize moduli spaces of special objects as locally symmetric varieties via Hodge theory. 
Well-known examples include moduli of polarized abelian varieties, Deligne-Mostow theory (moduli of weighted points on projective line), moduli of cubic hypersurfaces of dimension at most 4, moduli of polarized K3 surfaces, etc. I will first survey the existing results and ideas. Then I will introduce a new work with Chenglong Yu about several families of Calabi-Yau manifolds having periods in complex hyperbolic balls.

题目: Open WDVV equations for toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds  
摘要: The Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equations is an important system of equations in the study of
genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants. It implies the associativity of the quantum product. The associativity of the quantum product has many important applications including the recursive formula given by Kontsevich and Manin that calculates the Gromov-Witten invariants of the projective plane. The system of open WDVV equations plays an important role in the study of open Gromov-Witten invariants. It can be viewed as an extension of the WDVV equation to the open sector. The natural structure that captures the WDVV equation is that of a Frobenius manifold. Similarly, the system of open WDVV equations determines the structure of an F-manifold, a generalization of a Frobenius manifold. In this talk, we prove two versions of open WDVV equations for toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The first version leads to the construction of a semi-simple (formal) Frobenius manifold and the second version leads to the construction of a (formal) F-manifold. This is a joint work with Song Yu.

题目: Sheaves on non-reduced curves in a projective surface  
摘要: 1-dimensional sheaves on a surface are torsion sheaves supported at curves in the surface. Hence they are of rank zero. If we consider the moduli space of semistable 1-dimensional sheaves with determinant and Euler characteristic, then in general there are sheaves supported at singular curves. The Hilbert-Chow morphism sends each sheaf to its support. The fibers of  over integral curves are isomorphic to their (compactified) Jacobians, while those over non-integral curves are more complicated to understand. We estimate the dimension of the moduli stack  of pure sheaves supported at the non-reduced curve  with an integral curve. We then get that have all its fibers of the same dimension for a Fano surface or a surface with numerically trivial canonical line bundle, if |L| contains integral curves. The strategy is to firstly deal with the case with smooth and then do induction on the arithmetic genus of  which can decrease by a blow-up given singular.

题目: Sheaf stable pairs and birational geometry   
摘要: We build bridges between moduli theory of sheaf stable pairs on one hand and birational geometry on the other hand. 
We will in particular treat moduli of sheaf stable pairs on smooth projective curves in detail and present some calculations in low degrees. 
This is based on a joint work with Caucher Birkar and Artan Sheshmani.   

张子宇 (上海科技大学)    
题目: Some irreducible components of moduli spaces of stable bundles on hyperkähler manifolds  
摘要: Stable sheaves on K3 surfaces have been extensively studied. However, it is a challenging question to construct examples of stable sheaves on hyperkähler manifolds of higher dimensions. In this talk I will present several constructions, which produce irreducible components of the moduli spaces of such sheaves. In particular, one of the constructions yields an irreducible component with non-trivial canonical bundle. Based on joint work with Fabian Reede.   

刘治宇 (浙江大学)      
题目: Atomic sheaves on hyper-Kähler manifolds via Bridgeland moduli spaces  
摘要: Atomic sheaves on hyper-Kähler manifolds have well-behaved Hodge-theoretic properties, and are the natural analogs of simple sheaves on K3 surfaces. 
Despiting their nice properties, only a few concrete examples are known on general projective hyper-Kähler manifolds. 
In this talk, I will first review the theory of atomic sheaves, then I'll explain two methods to construct atomic sheaves supported on Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of stable objects in the K3 categories of Gushel-Mukai fourfolds. 
If time permits, I'd like to talk about an explicit example of atomic Lagrangians in a hyper-Kähler fourfold and relate it to a conjectural construction of new deformation types of hyper-Kähler manifolds. 
This is based on the joint work with Hanfei Guo.   

蒋云峰 (美国堪萨斯大学)        
题目: A SL_r/PGL_r-correspondence for algebraic surfaces   
摘要: For a real 4-dimensional manifold (a smooth projective surface in algebraic geometry) X, the S-duality conjecture implies that we should consider the moduli spaces of stable SL_r-Higgs bundles and stable PGL_r-Higgs bundles on X. 
The invariants defined by perfect obstruction theories on such moduli spaces are called the Vafa-Witten invariants, which were defined by Tanaka-Thomas in the SL_r side, and by Jiang-Kool in the PGL_r side. 
In this talk I will talk about the PGL_r/SL_r-correspondence for the Vafa-Witten invariants for these two sides in both K3 surfaces and general type surfaces.   

邱宇 (清华大学)     
题目: Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation  
摘要: We study the moduli space of quadratic differentials with simple zeros and prescribed polar type. 
We prove the fundamental group of which equals the kernel of Abel-Jacobi map. 
Then we discuss the partial compactification (with orbifolding) and categorification.   

杨迪 (中国科学技术大学)     
题目: Computations on Masur--Veech volumes of moduli spaces of quadratic differentials   
摘要: Based on the Chen--M\"oller--Sauvaget formula, we apply the theory of integrable systems to derive three Painle\'e-type equations for the generating series of the Masur--Veech (MV) volumes associated with the principal strata of the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials, and propose refinements of the conjectural formulas given by Delecroix--Goujard--Zograf--Zorich on the large genus asymptotics of the MV volumes. 
We will also apply the Delecroix--Goujard--Zograf--Zorich formula and Witten's intersection numbers to the study of the large genus asymptotics of the MV volumes. 
The talk is based on arXiv:2005.02275, arXiv:2110.06774.   

吴云辉 (清华大学)     
题目: Prime geodesic theorem and closed geodesics for large genus  
摘要: In this work, we study the Prime Geodesic Theorem for random hyperbolic surfaces. 
As an application, we show that as the genus g goes to infinity, on a generic hyperbolic surface in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus g, most closed geodesics of length significantly less than $\sqrt{g}$ are simple and non-separating, and most closed geodesics of length significantly greater than $\sqrt{g}$ are non-simple, confirming a conjecture of Lipnowski-Wright. This is a joint work with Yuhao Xue.  

孙哲 (中国科学技术大学)    
题目: Exponential volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces  
摘要: A decorated surface S is an oriented topological surface with marked points on the boundary considered modulo the isotopy. 
The ideal hyperbolic structure on S is the hyperbolic structures on S with geodesic boundary such that the hyperbolic structure near each marked point is a cusp, equipped with a horocycle near each such cusp. We consider the moduli space M_S(K,L) of ideal hyperbolic structures on S, which carries a canonical volume form that generalizes the Weil-Petersson volume form. But the volume of the space M_S(K,L) is infinite when the set of marked points is non-empty, also for its variation without horocycles. 
To fix this problem, we introduce the exponential volume form given by the volume form multiplied by the exponent of a canonical function on M_S(K,L).
We show that the exponential volume is finite. And we prove the recursion formulas for the exponential volumes, generalising Mirzakhani's recursions for the volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces. We expect the exponential volumes are relevant to the open string theory. This is a joint work with Alexander Goncharov.   

潘会平 (华南理工大学)    
题目: Algebraic intersection for hyperbolic surfaces                             
摘要: How much can two curves of given length intersect each other? In this talk, we will discuss the algebraic intersection form of hyperbolic surfaces. We will show that the algebraic intersection form has a minimum in the moduli space and that the minimum grows in the order $(\log g)^{-2}$ in terms of the genus. We will also describe the asymptotic behavior in the moduli space. This is a joint work with Manman Jiang.

冀诸超 (西湖大学)     
题目: The Dynamical André-Oort conjecture for rational maps  
摘要: This is a joint work with Junyi Xie. 
We prove the Dynamical André-Oort (DAO) conjecture proposed by Baker and DeMarco for families of rational maps parameterized by an algebraic curve. 
In fact, we prove a stronger result, which is a Bogomolov type generalization of DAO for curves.

苏伟旭 (复旦大学)    
题目: Thurston volume of the unit balls associated to quadratic differentials  
摘要: Let q be a holomorphic quadratic differential on a compact Riemann surface. 
We can associate q with a flat metric and a unit ball of the measured lamination space. 
We study the Thurston volume of the unit ball and give lower and upper bounds for the volume function on the moduli space. 
This is a joint work with Shenxing Zhang.   

范祐维 (清华大学)    
题目: Dynamical aspects of categories   
摘要: We will recall certain analogy between Teichmuller theory and triangulated categories, and discuss categorical results that are motivated from Teichmuller dynamics. 
Some open questions will be mentioned if time permitted.  

韩喆 (河南大学)     
题目: Groupoids from moduli space of quadratic differentials on Riemann surfaces  
摘要: By Bridgeland-Smith’s seminal work, the meromorphic quadratic differentials on compact Riemann surface could be realized as stability conditions on some triangulated categories. In this talk, I will introduce a groupoid given by cell structure of the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic differentials. 
Furthermore, I will explain the connection between the groupoid and topology of the moduli space. 
This is a joint work with A. King and Y. Qiu.  

李志远 (复旦大学)    
题目: Canonical cycles on moduli space of projective K3 surfaces and beyond  
摘要: In this talk, I will survey some results on studying algebraic cycles on moduli space of projective (marked) K3 surface. 
This includes the construction of tautological ring, Deligne-Beilinson cohomology of universal K3 surfaces and computation of Chern classes of tagent bundles of the moduli space.   

田志宇 (北京大学)    
题目: Homological stability and space of curves on some varieties  
摘要: Homological stability about moduli space of curves, or mapping class groups, is by now well-understood. 
I will discuss a set of conjectures as an attempt to understand homological stability of moduli space of curves on a very special class of varieties, such as the projective space, especially about their asymptotic behavior as the curve class becomes more and more positive. 
This talk will be mostly about motivations, questions, some non-trivial evidence, but very few answers.   

聂鑫 (东南大学)     
题目: Circle pattern and discrete conformality   
摘要: We give a survey of two closely related objects of study in discrete geometry: circle patterns and discrete conformal equivalence of polyhedral surfaces. 
The former deals with patterns of round circles on a surface whose combinatorics/topology is fixed, while the radii of circles may vary; the latter is a discrete analgoue of the usual conformal equivalence of Riemannian metrics. 
We will focus on the link between both subjects with hyperbolic geometry and Teichmüller spaces, and discuss some recent progress and open problems.  

何翔 (清华大学)       
题目: Balancing properties of tropical moduli maps  
摘要: Tropical varieties collects the combinatorial data of degenerations of algebraic varieties. 
In this talk, we explain how the tropicalization of a family of algebraic curves forms a family of tropical curves, and describe certain balancing conditions of the induced map to moduli space of tropical curves. If time permits, we will also discuss applications to liftability of tropical curves and irreducibility of Severi varieties. This is joint work with Karl Christ and Ilya Tyomkin.
